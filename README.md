# robotrader_tensorflow
robotrader_tensorflow script to start playing with tensorflow and machine learning for trading
Using data downloaded from my own framework and save it to excel<br>

The script try to predict best portfolio allocation in the input stocks.
I chose some ETF based on factors to try to time factors based on their data
and other inputs like spy , eurusd and tbond prices.<br>

ML will act as a blackbox trying to get the best relation between them to choose the 
best allocation.<br><br>
Will be a classiffication algorithm that is going to give us probabilities of the best choice

To install requirements (basically tensorflow, pandas numpy and sklearn)
pip install -r requirements.txt
